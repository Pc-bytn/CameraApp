| Requirement ID | Description                 | User Story                                                                                       | Expected Behavior/Outcome                                                                                                     |
|---------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FR001         | Basic Cordova App Setup     | As a user, I want a Cordova app that launches to a home page and can access the camera for live streaming. | The system should provide a Cordova app that launches to a home page with camera access and streaming functionality.         |
| FR002         | Camera Streaming Preview    | As a user, I want to see a live camera preview (stream) on the home page using my device's camera. | The app should display a live camera feed as a preview on the home page using WebRTC (not just a static preview).           |
| FR003         | Stream Control Button       | As a user, I want a button at the top of the camera preview to start or stop streaming.           | The app should display a button at the top of the camera preview. When pressed, it should start or stop the camera stream.   |
| FR004         | Permissions Handling        | As a user, I want the app to request and handle camera and audio permissions as needed.            | The app should request camera and audio permissions on startup and before streaming, and handle permission errors gracefully. |
| FR005         | Error Feedback              | As a user, I want to be notified of errors (e.g., permission denied, no camera found) via alerts. | The app should use alert dialogs to inform the user of errors or permission issues.                                           |
| FR006         | Camera Preview Display      | As a user, I want to see the camera preview displayed on my screen.                               | The app should show a real-time camera preview in a designated area of the screen before starting the stream.                |
| FR007         | Session Link Sharing        | As a user, I want to easily share the streaming session with others via a direct link.            | A "Send" button should appear next to the capture button. When pressed, it generates and shares using the system share dialog (Don't use seperate new plugin) a link containing the session ID that recipients can use to directly access the stream through viewer.html in their browser. |
